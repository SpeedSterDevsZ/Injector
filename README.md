# Injector

This is a Open Source CSharp Injector, mainly for Roblox.
Inject Code?

Injector.DllInjector.GetInstance.Inject("RobloxPlayerBeta", AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + "DllName.dll));

This can be used for a custom dll injector, or other stuff, credits to axon owners for this, i didnt make this.
